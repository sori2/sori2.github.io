Probability and statistics enable us to draw conclusions about the characteristics of data collected from a population. By understanding the probability of certain events and how to compute these probabilities, we can make informed decisions based on known features of the population. Before delving into probability computations, we need to establish foundational concepts such as the sample space and events within an experiment.

# Framework

## Random Experiment

A **random experiment** is any action or process whose outcome is subject to **uncertainty**. This means that even though we might perform the same experiment under the same conditions, the result could vary each time.

## Sample Space

Consider an experiment whose outcome is not predictable with certainty. However, although the outcome of the experiment will not be known in advance, let us suppose that the set of all possible **outcomes** is known. This set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is known as the **sample space** of the experiment. It is typically denoted as $S$ or $\Omega$.

## Event

An **event** is a **subset** of the sample space. An event $E$ is said to **occur** on a particular trial of the experiment if the outcome observed is an element of the set $E$.

### Example

For the random experiment of tossing a single die:

- The sample space $S$: 

$$S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$$

- Let $E$ be the event that "an even number is rolled." Then: 

$$E=\{2,4,6\}$$

In this case, $E$ is a subset of $S$. If the die lands on 2, 4, or 6, the event $E$ occurs.
